this text file contains information about the multirun mode.

multirun mode was created for people who wish to easily run the script on a large amount of accounts at once.
to use multirun, paste your tokens into the tokenlist.txt file.
the seperator is a newline, which means you have to leave every single token in a seperate line for them to be read by the launcher.

example of a properly formatted tokenlist.txt:
token1
token2
token3

just the tokens in seperate lines, nothing else required.
SET YOUR TOKEN TO multirun IN CONFIG.JSON AND LAUNCH THE SCRIPT TO ACTIVATE MULTITHREAD MODE.
i recommend disabling things that you wont need in the config, because it could lead to alot of log file spam.
