# SimpleSniper

**SimpleSniper is a Node.js script made for Discord, to serve as a useful utility tool for Discord users.**

The script is currently in very early development, so if you do use it, ill appreciate you sharing feedback or giving bug reports through github.

# Planned Features
- Friends Manager (notifications for friends adding/removing you)
- Control Server (ability to control the script, run commands and recieve webhook notifications in a private server)
- Server Monitor (notifications for being kicked/banned from servers, and for things that happen in the server)
- Nitro Sniper (detects and claims valid nitro gifts sent in servers, possibly getting you free nitro)
- Giveaway Sniper (automatic giveaway joiner which will add reactions to giveaway messages) 
- and some other things i cant think of

# FAQ
## Why does the script need my token?
the account token is required to be able to log in. if you think that your token would get sent off to a random webhook, read through the source code.

## Can i get banned?
the default config does not send any api requests other than the login one, which makes the script fairly safe to use. features with higher risks wont be added.
